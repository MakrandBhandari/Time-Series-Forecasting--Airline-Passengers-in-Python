# Time-Series-Forecasting--Airline-Passengers-in-Python

We will use Box-Jenkins methodology for time-series analysis :

Data conditioning & Model Selection : TS decomposition and Making TS stationary (Differencing & Dikey Fuller Test)
Estimation of model parameters : Compute coefficients of model
Model Validation : Analyzing residuals (normality, white noise, Ljung-Box test)
